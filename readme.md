# A tour of Go

List of the files I created while doing a [tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

Some comments, links and experimentaiton have been added.

The content in this repository will differ from the solutions of the go-tour
that are available in the `go-tour` package soure (should be installed in
`$GOPATH/src/code.google.com/p/go-tour`).
